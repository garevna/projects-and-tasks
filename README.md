# task-manager

This project works with backend-api (json-server).

To start the project, you need to start json-server.

If you don't know how to do it, google is helpful.

All scripts are described in package.json, install all packages and run json-server and dev

DB in the root of the project (file db.json)

The project is not completed because I'm tired. I'll finish it later.

It was actually a test job, but something seems like it's a pure scam. Just someone really needed to get a project like this for free. And that's how these guys get jobs.
