## API

The project allows two API options:

1. json-server
2. local database (IndexedDB).

### json-server

If you choose the first option, you will need to install the json-server package:

```bash
yarn add json-server
```

create a db.json file (to be honest, it would be easier to copy it from the repo)

and run the API on http://localhost:3000:

```bash
json-server db.json
```

and after that you can run the application and click "Yes" in the popup:

### local DB

If you are too lazy to mess around with API settings or json-server installation is a problem for you, you should choose the second option (i.e. click "No" in the pop-up window above), then you can work with the demo version without additional efforts on your part.

In this case, you have two options: either start with fake source data or start with a "clean slate", i.e. with empty databases.

If you are running the application for the first time, you have two options: either start with fake source data (click "Yes" in the next pop-up window) or start with a “clean slate”, i.e. with an empty database (click "No").

If you have run the application before and entered any data, click "No" to avoid corrupting your data.
